      <p>It has a population of 325,671 and an area of 103,000km2 (40,000sq mi), making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is <u>Reykjavik</u>; the surrounding areas in the South-West of the country are home to two thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists mainly of a plateau characterised by sand and alva fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea threough the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the <u>Gulf Stream</u> and has a temperate climate despite a hight latitude just outside of the Arctic Circle.</p>
      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>According to both <u>Landnamabok</u> and <u>Islendingabok</u>, Celtic monks known as the Papar lived in Iceland before the Norse settlers arrived, possibly members of the Hiberno-Scottish mission. Recent archaeological excavations have revealed the ruins of a cabin in Hafnir on the Reykjanes peninsula. <u>Carbon dating</u> indicates that it was abandoned somewhere betwen 779 and 880, suggesting that Iceland was populated well before 874. This archaeological find may also indicate that the monks left Iceland before the Norse arrived.</p>

      <p>Swedish Viking explorer <u>Gardar Svavarsson</u> was the first to circumnavigate Iceland in 870 and establish that it was an island. He stayed over winter and build a house in <u>Husavik</u>. Gardar departed the following summer but one of his men, Nattfari, decided to stay behind with two slaves. <u>Nattfari</u> settled in what is now known as Nattfaravik and became the first permanent resident of Iceland.</p>

      <p>Iceland is a representative democracy and a parliamentary republic. The modern parliament, <u>Alpingi</u> (English: Althing), was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the danish monarch. It was widely seen as a re-establishment of the assembly founded in 930 in the Commonwealth period and suspended in 1799. Consequently, "it is arguably the wordls's oldest parliamentary democracy." It currently has 63 members, elected for a maximum period of four years, with no term limit. The elections for president, the Althing and local municipal coucils are all help separately every four years.</p>
